	<question>
		Plot a linegraph with two lines, one for the number of journal papers and the other for the number of conference paper in every decade starting from 1950. Therefore the decades will be 1950-1959, 1960-1969, ...., 2000-2009, 2010-.

	/* Q4b.
	 * Plot a barchart showing how the average number of collaborators varied in
	 * these decades for conference papers in each of the four areas in Q3.
	 * Again, the decades will be 1950-1959, 1960-1969, ...., 2000-2009, 2010-.
	 * But for every decade, there will be four bars one for each area (do not
